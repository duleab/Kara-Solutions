## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Incremental model not processing new data
**Solution**: Check `is_incremental()` logic and unique_key configuration
```bash
dbt run --select model_name --full-refresh
```

#### Issue: Tests failing after model changes
**Solution**: Review test logic and update expectations
```bash
dbt test --select model_name --store-failures
```

#### Issue: Performance degradation
**Solution**: Analyze query plans and optimize indexes
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM your_model;
```

#### Issue: Data quality alerts firing
**Solution**: Investigate data sources and transformation logic
```bash
python scripts/data_quality_monitor.py --detailed
```
